# Sharphound

If you want to run Sharphound from a PC that is not joined to the target domain, open a command prompt and run:

```text
runas /netonly /user:DOMAIN\USER powershell.exe
Enter the password for DOMAIN\USER:
Attempting to start powershell.exe as user "DOMAIN\USER" ...
```

Then import Sharpound and run it as normal.

```text
import-module sharphound.ps1
invoke-bloodhound -collectionmethod all -domain TARGETDOMAIN
.\SharpHound.exe --CollectionMethod all -d valhalla.local
```
